# U.S. States Game üó∫Ô∏è

## Overview
The **U.S. States Game** is an interactive Python project where users test their knowledge of U.S. states by identifying them on a map. The game uses the `turtle` module for displaying the map and `pandas` for handling state data.

## How It Works
1. The program displays a blank map of the United States.
2. Users are prompted to input the name of a U.S. state.
3. Correct guesses are displayed on the map.
4. The game continues until the user identifies all 50 states or types **"Exit"**.

## File Requirements
1. **Input CSV File**:  
   The `50_states.csv` file contains the state names and their coordinates on the map.  
   Example structure:
   ```csv
   state,x,y
   Alabama,139,-77
   Alaska,-203,-180
   ...
